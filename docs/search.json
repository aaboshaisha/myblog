We change the quarto project configurtion to use “docs” folder as the output directory by modifying the .quarto.yml file using:\n\n\nproject:\ntype: website\noutput-dir: docs\n\n\n“Add a .nojekyll file to the root of your repository that tells GitHub Pages not to do additional processing of your published site using Jekyll (the GitHub default site generation tool):”\n\nOn a Mac this is: touch .nojekyll\n\nThen render the site quarto render\n\nadd and commit all files to github\n&gt;&gt; git add .\n&gt;&gt; git commit -m “Your message”\n&gt;&gt; git push\n\n“Finally, configure your GitHub repository to publish from the docs directory of your main branch:”\n\n Img src: https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html\nNow, the website can be accessed at:\n\nusername.github.io/reponame/\n\nwhere username is ur github username and reponame in this example is myblog\nNote-1: Add a new post to your blog by creating a sub-directory within posts, and adding an index.qmd file to the directory. That qmd file is the new blog post and when you render that, the blog home page will automatically update to include the newest post at the top of the listing.\nNote-2: Once u add new post, run quarto render in the terminal, then add, commit and push to github to apply the changes to your blog online."
